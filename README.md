### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I work as Platform Software Engineer at PicPay App. My first contact with programming was in the early 2000s, creating scripts for the IRC Clients. Since then, I have never stopped programming. I started my career working with Backend and Frontend and then I migrated to Mobile about 6 years ago. Iâ€™m an enthusiast of the software craftsmanship movement, I love creativity, and I always look for an alternative to everything.
